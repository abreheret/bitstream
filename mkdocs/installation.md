Bitstream supports Python 2.7 on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

We recommend you to install bitstream with pip. 
If for some reason that doesn't work for you 
-- for example if you want to modify the software -- 
you can also install bitstream from sources.

Install with Pip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the following prerequisites 

??? note "Pip"
    The pip package installer should be available for Python 2.7

        $ pip --version
        pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)

    Otherwise follow these [instructions][install-pip].

??? note "NumPy"
    Bitstream depends on the [NumPy] package; install it if necessary:

        $ pip install numpy

??? note "C compiler"
    You need a compiler pip can work with. 
    On Windows, you can install the 
    [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7][MSVC].

then install bitstream:

    $ pip install bitstream

[pip]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
[install-pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
[NumPy]: http://www.numpy.org/
[MSVC]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266




Install from Sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitstream is a [Cython] project.
Its source files have `.pyx` and `.pxd` extensions.

??? note "Download the Sources"

    For example, with [git](https://git-scm.com/):

        $ git clone https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream
        $ cd bitstream

??? note "Pip Install Dependencies"

    [Install the tools required for a pip install](#install-with-pip).

??? note "Cython" 

    [Install the Cython compiler][Installing Cython]. Typically:

        $ pip install Cython

You're now ready to install bitstream: run the command

        $ python setup.py --cython install

Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

??? warning "What if pip is available but associated to Python 3?"

    If `pip` refers to your Python 3 interpreter

        $ pip --version
        pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages (python 3.5)

    you may still have a version of pip for Python 2.7 installed.
    It may be named `pip2` or `pip2.7`; you can use it to install bitstream.
    Otherwise, refer to your Python 2.7 interpreter explicitly: 
    if it is named `python`

        $ python --version
        Python 2.7.12

    then install pip for Python 2.7 with

        $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

    and finally install bitstream

        $ python -m pip install bitstream


??? warning "The command `python setup.py install` doesn't work"

    This is expected:
    this command needs C files to build bitstream,
    which is a Python C extension module,
    but these files are not present in the git repository.
    They have first to be generated by the Cython compiler
    from the `.pyx` and `.pxd` files with:

        $ python setup.py --cython build

    To "solve" this issue, you can make the `--cython` option implicit
    with a `setup.cfg` file that contains:

        [global]
        cython = 1
