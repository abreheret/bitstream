-----

In the sequel we assume that you are in the project directory:

    $ https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream
    $ cd bitstream

Build from Sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitstream is a [Cython] project.
Its source files have `.pyx` and `.pxd` extensions. 

To build and install bitstream from its git repository:

  - [install the tools required for a classic install](installation),

  - [install the Cython compiler][Cython],

then execute:

    $ python setup.py --cython install

??? warning "The command `python setup.py install` doesn't work"

    This is expected:
    this command needs C files to build bitstream,
    which is a Python C extension module,
    but these files are not present in the git repository.
    They have first to be generated by the Cython compiler
    from the `.pyx` and `.pxd` files with:

        $ python setup.py --cython build

    To "solve" this issue, you can make the `--cython` option implicit
    with a `setup.cfg` file that contains:

        [global]
        cython = 1

Run the Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run all the tests, install `pyyaml`[^1] then install bitstream and type

     $ python test.py

[^1]: `pip install pyyaml`

If nothing happens, your version of bitstream is probably fine: 
all the code snippets
used [in the documentation](http://boisgera.github.io/bitstream/)
have been checked by [doctest] and have correct outputs.
To find out more about these tests, run

     $ python test.py -v

The bitstream project uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) 
to run all the tests on each new commit. 
If you fork bitstream, make sure to [activate Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).
To add new tests, just [update the documentation](#documentation).

Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The documentation is built with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and its 
[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
Install them with:

    $ pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

The documentation sources are markdown files located 
in the [`mkdocs`](https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream/tree/master/mkdocs)
directory and assembled according to the configuration file 
[`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream/blob/master/mkdocs.yml).
Build the docs[^build] with

    $ mkdocs build

This command outputs HTML documentation into the `docs` directory.

[^build]:
  For work in progress, use `mkdocs serve`: it creates a web server 
  that listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and refreshes automatically
  the documentation when its source files change.
